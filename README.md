# ‚¨°‚¨¢‚¨° Dribdat ‚¨°‚¨¢‚¨°

**An open source hackathon management application that playfully assists your team in crowdsourcing technical designs.** 

Designed to bootstrap your [awesome hackathon](https://github.com/dribdat/awesome-hackathon), Dribdat's toolset can be used as a versatile toolbox for civic tech sprints. To get started, [install](#Quickstart) the software. 

üö≤ See [Tour de Hack](https://dribdat.cc/tour) for examples, and [User handbook](https://dribdat.cc/usage) for screenshots. üèîÔ∏è There are mirrors on [Codeberg](https://codeberg.org/dribdat/dribdat) and [GitHub](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat). ü©µ Support us on [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/dribdat/updates)

# Purpose

Created in light of the [Hacker ethic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hacker_ethic), the Zen of Dribdat is (in a nutshell):

- **Commit sustainably**: archive collected results in open, web-friendly data formats.
- **Live and let live**: share designs, dev envs, docs accessible to your entire team.
- **Co-create in safe spaces**: promote safer conduct and increased privacy.

Visit the [Hackfinder](https://hackintegration.ch/hackfinder) to find events connected to current research, and join our [Hack:Org:X](https://hackorgx.dribdat.cc) meetings to say 'hi' to the maintainers and fellow hackathon organizers.

For more background and references, see the üìñ [User Handbook](https://docs.dribdat.cc/usage). If you need help or advice in setting up your site, or would like to contribute to the project: please get in touch via üó£Ô∏è [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/dribdat/discussions).

# Quickstart

The Dribdat project can be deployed to any server capable of serving [Python](https://python.org) applications, and is set up for fast deployment using [Ansible or Docker](https://dribdat.cc/deploy) üèÄ The first user that registers becomes an admin, so don't delay when you make your play!

If you would like to run this application on any other cloud or local machine, there are instructions in the [Deployment guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/deploy). Information on contributing and extending the code can be found in the [Contributors guide](https://docs.dribdat.cc/contribute), which includes API documentation, and other details.

See also **[backboard](https://github.com/dribdat/backboard)**: a responsive, modern alternative frontend, and our **[dridbot](https://github.com/dribdat/dridbot)** chat client. Both demonstrate reuse of the dribdat API. If you need support with your deployment, please reach out through [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/dribdat/discussions). Pull Requests and Issues welcome!

# Credits

This application was based on [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask) by [Steven Loria](https://github.com/sloria), a more modern version of which is [cookiecutter-flask-restful](https://github.com/karec/cookiecutter-flask-restful). [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html#available-templates) could also be a good bootstrap for your own hackathon projects!

‚ô° The [Open Data](https://opendata.ch), [Open Networking](https://opennetworkinfrastructure.org/) and [Open Source](https://dinacon.ch) communities in üá®üá≠ Switzerland gave this project initial form and direction through a hundred events. ‚ô•-felt thanks to our [Contributors](https://github.com/dribdat/dribdat/graphs/contributors), and additionally: F.
