This application was based on [cookiecutter-flask](https://github.com/sloria/cookiecutter-flask) by [Steven Loria](https://github.com/sloria), a more modern version of which is [cookiecutter-flask-restful](https://github.com/karec/cookiecutter-flask-restful). [Cookiecutter](https://cookiecutter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/README.html#available-templates) could also be a good bootstrap for your own hackathon projects!
